	<h1>The Three Principles</h1>
	<h2>The Members look to Saint Lydia as a guide to true femininity.  Saint Pope John Paul II speaks of the “feminine genius:'' the unique gift of sensitivity toward others and of nurturing love. Women are called to live their unique vocation, having been entrusted in a particular way with “the order of love” (Mulieris Dignitatem § 30).  God created male and female with equal dignity, honor and value; each beloved by God with a glorious destiny. Equality in this sense does not undermine the unique and distinct vocation of each.  To foster that which is authentically and uniquely “feminine,” the Society delineates the following three principles.</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Beauty: The four attributes of God are One, True, Good and Beautiful.  Things that are beautiful inspire us to greatness, wonder, and awe.  Beauty draws us into the divine.  It has been said that beauty will save the world.  There is nothing more beautiful than the love which is the Most Holy Trinity, a love that was revealed in the person of Jesus Christ.  The Members commit themselves to live a life of beauty: beautifying this world by their life, words and actions.</li>
		<li>Modesty: Genuine feminine beauty is best expressed through modesty, which both guards and shows forth what is beautiful.  Modest beauty leads to holiness, unity, and confidence. Immodest beauty, on the other hand, leads to lust, disintegration, and loneliness.  The Members are committed to be modest in their speech, appearance, and actions. (1 Tim., 2:10).</li>
		<li>Maternity: All women are called to be mothers, some physically, all spiritually. Each Member by her feminine genius commits to the building up of goodness, hope, and love through her God-given gift of maternal instinct.</li>
